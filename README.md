# ARproperty



This project is developed with a motive of improving the standards of property advertisements. A typical ad has few details and images of the property , to make it more engaging for the viewers I developed an application in which the same advertisement can act as source of interaction. The app uses the concept of nodes which we would pre-defining , when the same image is brought in front of our app it projects the  particular pre defined model. The images are known as target images.
Features---
1) First person view --- This feature allows people to engage with the property as  this is similar to moving a character in a game. There are keypads which would help the viewer to move and rotate in any direction to have a clear cut view of the property.
2) AR view ---  This feature allows users to view the 3d model of the property along with providing the option of having a look at the same by removing a particular component. Say for example I can view how the property looks by removing the roof / how it looks in night mode etc. 

The images of both them are attached below.

The advertisement with a QR code is our revised advertisement and the images on it are target images.

As both advertisements have same images you can use anyone to view the app , but the one with QR code is made only to differentiate of how the old ads can be turned in to something more interesting.

The one with a QR code is the revised advertisement in which both the images present add an interactive angle to the ad. 

The app is given in the apk format.


Make sure you are using an android device that supports vuforia augmented reality and the minimum api level is 26 , internet is turned on.
