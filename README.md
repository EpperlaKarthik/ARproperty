# ARproperty


Whole Idea of this project is making property advertisements interactive and more engaging.

There are 2 images named n1 and n3.
The one with a QR code is the revised advertisement in which both the images present add an interactive angle to the ad. 
The app is given in the apk format.


Make sure you are using an android device that supports vuforia augmented reality and the minimum api level is 26 , internet is turned on.

Image 1 for video.
Image 2 for AR Experience.

There might be a delay in video to play , hence press the play button 3-4 times if it doesnot play in the first attempt.
